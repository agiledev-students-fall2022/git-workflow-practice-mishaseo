# What I Find Interesting About The Article

The article was really interesting to me being someone who wants to be a software developer in the future. While coding, I generally focus on accomplishing the problem at hand, following my own pattern of development.  However, this article reminded me of the general yet essential rules, which are very helpful to follow as a software developer. This article layed out factors relating to development, troubleshooting, cooperation, as well as other aspects such as experimentation, ultimately the key elements or general rules of thumb for software development. Therefore, I found this article to be super interesting, since it brought to light many of the aspects that could help me become a better software developer, details which I never considered.

The article contained so much useful information that I will certainly look back on while developing applications in the future and I really think it ties closely with what we have been learning in class about following a clear framework (Scrum). One lesson that he mentioned really stood out to me: "rubber ducking". My professor from last semester gifted all our class students a mini rubber duck to remind us to always talk through a problem whenever we get stuck on a problem and it is something that I have found to be really helpful and worthwhile. Sometimes when a trouble arises, there is a tendency to reach out to people and ask for help, but often times, just thinking out loud helps to find the key to the issue!
